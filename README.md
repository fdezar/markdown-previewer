# Markdown Previewer

Markdown Previewer is a simple web application that allows you to write and preview Markdown text in real-time. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the `marked.js` library for parsing Markdown.

This project constitutes one of the five mandatory projects for my freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Certification.
